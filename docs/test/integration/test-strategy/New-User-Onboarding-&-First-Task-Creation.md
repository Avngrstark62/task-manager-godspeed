# Integration Test Strategy Document

## Testing Framework
jest

## Feature Information
- **Name**: New User Onboarding & First Task Creation
- **Description**: A new user registers and creates their first task.

## Involved Routes and Flow Description
This feature involves two sequential API calls to simulate a new user's complete onboarding process:
1.  **`POST /users`**: This route is responsible for creating a new user in the system. It takes the user's `name` and `email` as input and returns the newly created user object, including their unique `id`.
2.  **`POST /tasks`**: After a user is successfully created, this route is used to create their first task. It requires a `title`, `description`, and the `userId` of the user to whom the task belongs.

The overall flow is as follows:
- A request is made to `POST /users` to register a new user.
- The response from the user creation is used to extract the new `userId`.
- A subsequent request is made to `POST /tasks`, using the `userId` from the previous step to associate the task with the new user.

## Test Data & Setup
- **Test Data**:
  - **User Data**: A unique email and name for the new user (e.g., `test-user-` + timestamp + `@example.com`).
  - **Task Data**: A title and description for the first task (e.g., "Complete onboarding", "Fill out profile information").
- **Setup**:
  - The Godspeed application must be running, which can be started with the `godspeed serve` command.
  - The test environment should have a clean database to ensure that there are no conflicts with existing users, especially concerning unique email constraints.
  - No special environment variables are required beyond the standard database connection string.

## Test Cases
### 1. Happy Path: Successful User Registration and First Task Creation
- **Description**: This test case verifies the end-to-end success flow where a new user is created and then successfully creates their first task.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Send a `POST` request to `/users` with a unique email and a name.
  2.  Assert that the response status code is `201 Created`.
  3.  Assert that the response body contains the new user's `id`, `name`, and `email`.
  4.  Extract the `id` from the response.
  5.  Send a `POST` request to `/tasks` with a `title`, `description`, and the `userId` obtained in the previous step.
  6.  Assert that the response status code is `201 Created`.
  7.  Assert that the response body contains the new task's `id`, `title`, `description`, and the correct `userId`.
  8.  Verify in the database that both the user and the task were created correctly.

### 2. Failure Path: Task Creation for a Non-existent User
- **Description**: This test case ensures that the system correctly handles attempts to create a task for a user that does not exist.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Generate a random, non-existent `userId` (e.g., a UUID).
  2.  Send a `POST` request to `/tasks` with a `title`, `description`, and the non-existent `userId`.
  3.  Assert that the response status code is `404 Not Found`.
  4.  Assert that the response body contains an appropriate error message (e.g., "User not found").

### 3. Failure Path: User Registration with a Duplicate Email
- **Description**: This test case verifies that the system prevents the creation of a new user if their email address already exists in the database.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Send a `POST` request to `/users` with a unique email and a name to create a user.
  2.  Assert that the first request is successful with a `201 Created` status.
  3.  Send another `POST` request to `/users` using the *same email address* as in the first step.
  4.  Assert that the response status code is `400 Bad Request`.
  5.  Assert that the response body contains an appropriate error message (e.g., "A user with this email already exists").

## Coverage Matrix
| Feature Milestone | Test Case(s) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| User created successfully | Happy Path: Successful User Registration and First Task Creation | Covered |
| First task created successfully | Happy Path: Successful User Registration and First Task Creation | Covered |
| Attempt to create a task for a non-existent user | Failure Path: Task Creation for a Non-existent User | Covered |
| Attempt to create a user with a duplicate email | Failure Path: User Registration with a Duplicate Email | Covered |

## Cleanup Strategy
- After each test run, all data created during the test must be removed from the database to ensure test isolation and a clean state for subsequent runs.
- This can be achieved using a global `afterAll` or `afterEach` hook in the test suite.
- The cleanup process should involve deleting the created user and task from the database. A cascading delete on the user should also remove their associated tasks if the database schema is set up that way. Otherwise, tasks should be deleted first, followed by the user.
- Example cleanup logic:
  ```javascript
  // In the test file, using Prisma client
  afterAll(async () => {
    // Delete the task created in the test
    await prisma.task.deleteMany({ where: { userId: createdUserId } });
    // Delete the user created in the test
    await prisma.user.delete({ where: { id: createdUserId } });
  });
  ```
