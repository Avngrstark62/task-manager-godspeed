# Functional Test Strategy Document

## Testing Framework
jest

## Route Information
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Path:** `/tasks`
- **Purpose:** To create a new task associated with a user.
- **Middleware:** None explicitly defined in the event file, but Godspeed's default middleware for body parsing will apply.
- **Authentication:** No authentication middleware is specified for this route. Access is public.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "title": "string (required)",
    "description": "string (optional)",
    "userId": "string (required, must be a valid user ID)"
  }
  ```
- **Success Response (201):**
  ```json
  {
    "id": "string",
    "title": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "completed": "boolean",
    "userId": "string"
  }
  ```
- **Error Responses:**
  - `400 Bad Request`: If the title is missing or empty.
  - `404 Not Found`: If the `userId` does not exist.
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: For any other server-side errors.

## Test Data & Setup
- **Test User:** A user must be created in the database before running the tests to provide a valid `userId`.
  - **Data:** `{ "name": "Test User", "email": "test.user@example.com" }`
- **Test Task Data:**
  - **Valid:** `{ "title": "A valid task", "description": "A valid description" }`
  - **Invalid (Missing Title):** `{ "description": "A task with no title" }`
  - **Invalid (Empty Title):** `{ "title": "", "description": "A task with an empty title" }`
- **Setup Steps:**
  1. Before all tests, ensure the database is clean.
  2. Before each test that requires a user, create a new user and store their ID.
  3. The Godspeed application must be running. This can be achieved by executing `godspeed serve` in a separate terminal.

## Test Cases
### 1. End-to-End Success Path
- **Test Case:** `should create a new task successfully with valid data`
- **Implementation Guide:**
  - **Setup:** Create a user and get their ID.
  - **Steps:**
    1. Send a `POST` request to `/tasks` with a valid `title`, `description`, and the created `userId`.
  - **Assertions:**
    1. Expect the HTTP status code to be `201`.
    2. Expect the response body to be a valid task object, containing the correct `title`, `description`, `userId`, and a boolean `completed` property set to `false`.
    3. Verify that the `id` in the response is a non-empty string.
    4. **Database Validation:** Query the database to confirm that the task was created with the correct data and is associated with the correct user.

### 2. Error Handling
- **Test Case:** `should return a 404 error if the userId does not exist`
- **Implementation Guide:**
  - **Steps:**
    1. Send a `POST` request to `/tasks` with a valid `title` and a non-existent `userId` (e.g., a random UUID).
  - **Assertions:**
    1. Expect the HTTP status code to be `404`.
    2. Expect the response body to contain a `message` property with the value "User not found".

- **Test Case:** `should return a 400 error if the title is missing`
- **Implementation Guide:**
  - **Setup:** Create a user and get their ID.
  - **Steps:**
    1. Send a `POST` request to `/tasks` with a `userId` but without a `title`.
  - **Assertions:**
    1. Expect the HTTP status code to be `400`.
    2. Expect the response body to contain a `message` property with the value "Title cannot be empty".

- **Test Case:** `should return a 400 error if the title is an empty string`
- **Implementation Guide:**
  - **Setup:** Create a user and get their ID.
  - **Steps:**
    1. Send a `POST` request to `/tasks` with a `userId` and an empty string for the `title`.
  - **Assertions:**
    1. Expect the HTTP status code to be `400`.
    2. Expect the response body to contain a `message` property with the value "Title cannot be empty".

### 3. Edge Cases
- **Test Case:** `should create a task successfully without a description`
- **Implementation Guide:**
  - **Setup:** Create a user and get their ID.
  - **Steps:**
    1. Send a `POST` request to `/tasks` with a valid `title` and `userId`, but no `description`.
  - **Assertions:**
    1. Expect the HTTP status code to be `201`.
    2. Expect the response body to be a valid task object.
    3. Expect the `description` property in the response to be `null` or `undefined`.
    4. **Database Validation:** Confirm the task was created in the database with a null or empty description.

## Coverage Matrix
| Requirement/Logic Branch | Test Case(s) | Status |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| Successful task creation | `should create a new task successfully with valid data` | Ready |
| Non-existent user | `should return a 404 error if the userId does not exist` | Ready |
| Missing title | `should return a 400 error if the title is missing` | Ready |
| Empty title | `should return a 400 error if the title is an empty string` | Ready |
| Missing description | `should create a task successfully without a description` | Ready |

## Cleanup Strategy
- **After Each Test:**
  - Delete any tasks created during the test.
  - Delete any users created during the test.
- This ensures that tests are isolated and do not interfere with each other. A common approach is to use `afterEach` or `afterAll` hooks in Jest to perform the cleanup by calling the respective `DELETE` endpoints or directly manipulating the database.
